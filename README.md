My Portfolio

This site came about from a core belief of mine. I did not want to be beholden to the restrictions of the any of the templated portfolio website. Nor do I agree with the practices of most subscription-based services. The most significant reason I built my site is one-in-the-same as the handful of apps linked here. I couldn't find a product that fit all the criteria that I wanted; So, I built it.

With years of experience behind me, I've built a rich set of skills to tackle all manners of problems. What began as a deep fascination for how things work, has now evolved into a passion for crafting elegant solutions to complex problems. As a leader, I stand by the principle to "Lead by Example". and to "Empower Others to Succeed". A leader should never ask those around them to do things they are not willing to do themselves. I believe in creating an environment where everyone can thrive, contribute, and educate others.

I thrive both in collaborative environments and working alone. Working closely with fellow designers, project managers, and backend engineers to bring ideas to life. I'm a firm believer in lifelong learning and constantly explore new technologies to stay at the forefront of Art and Design and the intersection of technology.
